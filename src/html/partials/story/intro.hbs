<div class="prose-container">
	<p>New York wasn’t just 18 million people—it had a form. Every city was a unique mountain that might be like the steep peaks of lower Manhattan or the sprawling hills of suburban Atlanta. When I first saw a city in 3D, I had a <i>feel</i> for its size that didn’t exist before.
	</p>
	<p>That feeling goes a long way to improve my own geographic instincts. In 1993, there were 14 cities over 10 million people. Today, 20 more cities qualify (and an additional 11 by 2030), with many sprouting from farmland in our lifetimes. Unless you’ve visited or tracked its growth closely, the scale of a new, 10 million- person city can be hard to believe.
	</p>
	<div class="break">
	</div>
	<p>Among them is Kinshasa, DR Congo (13 million people), which I now know to be bigger than historically familiar cities. I had seen it outrank Paris (11 million people) in population bar charts and data tables. Yet it wasn’t until I saw the population as a form, rather than a number, could I appreciate how large Kinshasa had become.
	</p>
	<p>The 3D view left me with a better appreciation for the world’s center of “human” mass, especially the weight of Africa and Asia. First, let’s tour a few cities you might have visited, giving you a sense of what 10M people “looks like.”
