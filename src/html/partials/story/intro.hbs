		<p>The world’s population centers are a lot different than 25 years ago. In 1993, there were 14 cities over 10 million people. Today, there are 34, with many of these new “megacities” sprouting from farmland in our lifetimes.</p>
		<!-- <p>It’s happened so fast that our own geography insticts—what we learned in school—is at odds with reality.</p> -->
		<p>Rather than list off the new metropolises that might suprise your geographic instincts, I want to show you what 10 million people <b>looks like</b>.</p>
